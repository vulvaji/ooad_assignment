User Stories:
==============

User Story 1:
    As a user
	I want to find the Number of steps to reach the square 1 in spiral memory for min positive number
	So that i can show the Number of steps to carried back to square 1.
	
User Story 2:
    As a user
	I want to find the Number of steps to reach the square 1 in spiral memory for max positive number [here 2000 is max integer]
	So that i can show the Number of steps to carried back to square 1.

User Story 3:
   As a User 
   I want to have a validation message as "You have entered Invalid Entry [Ex. 0 or Negative numbers or Invalid Alpha numerical characters]."
   So that I can display the error message if I enter the input as negative or Non Numeric or 0 
  
   
Acceptance Criteria:
====================

Acceptance Criteria 1:
	Given a Spiral Memory Generator is available
	When I enter 1 as a list of squares [min value /starting point] in a spiral memory
	Then the system should find the steps to reach the Starting point
	And the system should display 0 as the no of steps to reach square 1

Acceptance Criteria 2:
	Given a Spiral Memory Generator is available
	When I enter 10 as the input to the list of squares
	Then the system should display 3 as the steps to return to the square 1

Acceptance Criteria 3:
	Given a Spiral Memory Generator is available
	When I enter 2000 as the input to the list of squares
	Then the system should display 25 as the steps to return to the square 1


Acceptance Criteria 4:
	Given a Spiral Memory Generator is available
	When I enter 1024 as the input to the list of squares
	Then the system should display 31 as the steps to return to the square 1

Acceptance Criteria 5:
	Given a Spiral Memory Generator is available
	When I enter a valid random number as a square element [min value /starting point] in a spiral memory
	Then the system should find the No of steps
	And the system should display 0 as the no of steps to reach square 1


Acceptance Criteria 6:
	Given a Spiral Memory Generator is available
	Then i enter valid predefined square element as "0" for a spiral memory
	Then the  system should display an error message as "You have entered Invalid Entry [Ex. 0 or Negative numbers or Invalid Alpha numerical characters]."


Acceptance Criteria 7:
	Given a Spiral Memory Generator is available
	When I enter valid predefined square element as "-10" [Negative Number] for a spiral memory
	Then the  system should display an error message as "You have entered Invalid Entry [Ex. 0 or Negative numbers or Invalid Alpha numerical characters]."


Acceptance Criteria 8:
	Given a Spiral Memory Generator is available
	When i enter invalid square element [Alphanumeric text] in a spiral memory
	Then the  system should display an error message as "You have entered Invalid Entry [Ex. 0 or Negative numbers or Invalid Alpha numerical characters]."
